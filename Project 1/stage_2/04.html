			<h1> The New Typography </h1> 

			<h2> [1923] </h2>

			<h3> Laszlo Moholy-Nagy </h3> 

			<h6> Typography is a tool of communication. <br /> It must be communication in its most intense form. <br /> The emphasis must be on <strong> absolute clarity </strong> <br /> since this distinguishes the character of our own writing <br /> from that of ancient pictographic forms. <br /> Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact <br /> <em> (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition <br /> toward a collective-exact orientation). </em> <br /> This is in contrast to the <em> ancient individual-amorphous </em> <br /> and later collective - <em> amorphous mode of communication. </em> <br /> Therefore priority: <strong> unequivocal clarity </strong> in all typographical compositions. <br /> Legibility-communication must never be  <br /> impaired by an a priori aesthetics. </h6>
