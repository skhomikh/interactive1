<div class="title"> Looking VS. Seeing: Public Transportation </div>

<div class="text"> 

	<p><em> Public transportation certainly has its pros and cons.</em> </p>

	<p> The smell of fresh, still wet <span> sweat pouring off the hipster biker to your right. </span> The middle school children yelling and screaming stupidity. The cries of a baby and the site of a single elderly woman, looking both wise and lonely in the eyes. <span> All have stories, pasts, heartache and joy different to our own. </span> </p>

	<p> All joined together on an average day. <span> Some on their way to work. Some to an unknown destination. </span> Some looking for themselves, new places, new friends. </p>

	<p> I often make an effort to look closely at my surroundings, and form stories for the people around me. I wonder if my story is any more <span> rich and vibrant then the woman across from me or behind me. </span> I wonder, what kind of struggles have they overcome. </p>

	<p> The bus creaks and crokes.</p>


	<p> The bus takes a stop, <span> a destination to some, a disadvantage of time for others. </span> It crokes and it creaks time and time again. But with each stop a story enters and a story leaves. <span>  The air fills itself with breadths of pure happiness </span>, anger, excitement confusion and despair. And it moves on. Every second, every hour, everyday. It moves, it gets you where you need to go. <span> And most fail to notice, theyâ€™re not alone.</span> </p>
