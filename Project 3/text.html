	<div class="title"> Looking VS. Seeing: Public Transportation </div>

	<div class="text"> 

		Public transportation certainly has its pros and cons. The smell of fresh, still wet sweat pouring off the hipster biker to your right. The middle school children yelling and screaming stupidity. The cries of a baby and the site of a single elderly woman, looking both wise and lonely in the eyes. All have stories, pasts, heartache and joy different to our own. All joined together on an average day. Some on their way to work. Some to an unknown destination. Some looking for themselves, new places, new friends. 

	</div>

	<div class="text"> 

		I often make an effort to look closely at my surroundings, and form stories for the people around me. I wonder if my story is any more rich and vibrant then the woman across from me or behind me. I wonder, what kind of struggles have they overcome. 

	</div>

	<div class="text">
		The bus creaks and crokes

	</div>


	<div class="text">

		The bus takes a stop, a destination to some, a disadvantage of time for others. It crokes and it creaks time and time again. But with each stop a story enters and a story leaves. The air fills itself with breadths of pure happiness, anger, excitement confusion and despair. And it moves on. Every second, every hour, everyday. It moves, it gets you where you need to go. And most fail to notice, theyâ€™re not alone.
